# my-first-cat-website

This site is live at https://diana-atas.github.io/my-first-cat-website/da-assignment1/

Of course, my first website has to be about cats!
This website was submitted as part of my Web Development assessment at Massey U.

Note to self: fix that link, reorganise the files, see pull request, refactor...
